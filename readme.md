###Task Tracker
Hi, this is a project that follows the requiriments of [TaskTracker](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker). However, I have used Junit5 to develop with TDD.
To execute use this command:
  ```java -jar TaskTracker.jar _options_
The _options_ could be:
* ```add _new task_
* ```delete _id_
* ```update _id_ _updated task_
* ```mark-in-progress _id_
* ```mark-done _id_
* ```list
* ```list todo
* ```list in-progress
* ```list done
